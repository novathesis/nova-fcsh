# NOVA-FCSH Thesis Template

This is a **customized LaTeX template** for theses and reports at **Faculdade de Ciências Sociais e Humanas da Universidade NOVA de Lisboa**) (NOVA FCSH), following the most recent [NOVA FCSH guidelines (in Portuguese)](https://intranet.fcsh.unl.pt/formularios-e-modelos-academicos).

This template is a streamlined and fine-tuned version of the robust [NOVAthesis](https://github.com/joaomlourenco/novathesis) framework (v7.10.0), trimmed down and optimized to provide NOVA-FCSH students with a streamlined experience, meeting NOVA-FCSH's academic formatting standards without the complexity of the original multi-institution template. Key features retained in this NOVA-FCSH-specific version include:

* **NOVA-FCSH-Ready:** Pre-configured with the correct margins, cover page styles, and fonts required by NOVA-FCSH.
* **Streamlined:** Unnecessary files and configurations for other universities and languages (other than PT and EN) have been removed, making the template lighter and easier to navigate. 
* **Modern Academic Standards:**
  * **AI Disclosure:** Integrated support for the new Artificial Intelligence Disclosure Statement.
  * **SDGs:** Visual enumeration of the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) for modern research impact reporting.
* **User-Friendly Design:** Optimized for both LaTeX beginners and power users, ensuring a clean and efficient workflow.
